            Hi friends

I am Neal Santhosh

I am a student currently studying in 8th standard. I started this blog when I was studying in 6th standard. You may be wondering how I came upon the idea of making a blog and a selling website? Who helped me make the website? And how do I get the Interest of making a website? It goes like this.  

  I grew up in my parent’s office. I grew up seeing my parent’s program different software. That is how I got an interest in programming. Website making is also a part of programming. My parents encroached me for making the website mainly my father. They helped me by teaching me how programming is done and how to make a wonderful website. They suggested that I should make a blog. At last, I reached the decision that I should make a Blog and a selling website.

The blog is the main focus of this website. I thought of blogging as I can spread my interest as I know that they will help you with these interests and their benefits. The first one is reading helps in improving vocabulary. The next one is playing the piano helps in improving the function of the brain. I have so many interests that I can write for pages. This website also consists of selling books. I hope that you are having a wonderful time when visiting here. If there is any suggestion don’t hesitate to comment and please give feedback on the writing. There is a comment section under every writing and Happy Reading!!!!
